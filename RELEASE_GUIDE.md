# Alternative CI Configuration Options

## Option 1: Disable Release Job Completely (Safest)
If you want to disable automatic releases entirely, change the release job condition to:

```yaml
release:
  if: false  # Disable automatic releases
  needs: build
  # ... rest of job
```

## Option 2: Manual Release Only
Only release when manually triggered or on git tags:

```yaml
release:
  if: github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' || (github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/'))
  # ... rest of job
```

## Option 3: Environment-based Release
Use GitHub environments to control releases:

```yaml
release:
  if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  needs: build
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  environment: release  # Requires approval
  # ... rest of job
```

## Setting Up TestPyPI (When Ready)

1. Create TestPyPI account: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
2. Generate API token: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
3. Add secret to GitHub repo: Settings > Secrets > Actions > New repository secret
   - Name: `TEST_PYPI_API_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your TestPyPI API token (starts with `pypi-`)

## Creating a Release

To create a release when ready:

```bash
# Tag a version
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0

# This will trigger the release workflow
```
